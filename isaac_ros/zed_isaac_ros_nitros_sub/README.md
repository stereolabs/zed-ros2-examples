This is an example that subscribes to ZED camera topics using NITROS and displays communication benchmarks.

The example shows the difference in performance when using NITROS compared to standard ROS2 communication.

Details about the examples are available in the [Isaac ROS with ZED documentation](https://docs.stereolabs.com/isaac-ros).
